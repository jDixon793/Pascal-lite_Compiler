# Pascal-lite_Compiler
A Pascal-lite compiler that converts a Pascal like syntax into a teaching version of machine language used at Angelo State University called RAMM. Created as the final project in CS4301: Algorithmic Languages &amp; Compilers.

The project contains 4 parts:
0) RAMM
The information about the teaching version of machine language at Angelo State University called RAMM.
1) Stage0
The first stage of the project. This implemented reading through a simple Pascal program and checking the syntax.
2) Stage1
The second stage of the project. This implemented reading through a Pascal program and emitting the correct RAMM file for different operations.
3) Stage2
The third stage of the project. This implemented loops and conditional statements.
